# 1: Introduction to the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB)

First, let's see what is in the PDC database-- the main repository of protein structures. 

Downloaded composition stats from: hhtps://www.rcsb.org/stats/summary

For context: Release 2023_04 of 13-Sept-2023 of UniProt/TrEMBL contains 251600,768 sequence entries. The PDB only contains 183,201.

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("PDBstats.csv", row.names=1)
stats
```

There's a problem here due to the commas in the numbers. This causes R to treat them as characters.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray
x
```


```{r}
as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
```

```{r}
rm.comma <- function(x) {
  as.numeric(gsub(",", "", x))
}
```

```{r}
rm.comma(stats$EM)
```

I can use `apply()` to fix the whole table...

```{r}
pdbstats <- apply(stats, 2, rm.comma)
rownames(pdbstats) <- rownames(stats)
head(pdbstats)
```
Without the `row.names=1`, it would make the column values `NA`. Save this matric to a vector & reinsert the rownames using `rownames()`.

This can also be done using the `readr` package.

**Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.**
```{r}
totals <- apply(pdbstats, 2, sum)
round(totals/totals["Total"] * 100, 2)
```
93.16% of structures in the PDB are solved by X-ray & EM.

**Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?**
```{r}
round(pdbstats[, "Total"]/sum(pdbstats[,"Total"]) * 100, 2)
```
86.67% of thructures in the PDB are protein.

**Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?**
SKIPPED

# 2. Visualizing the HIV-1 protease structure

**Q4: Water molecules normally have 3 atoms. Why do we see just one atom per water molecule in this structure?**
This is a 2 Angstrom structure and Hydrogen is not visible at this resolution. You need 1A or better to view the entirety of the water molecule.

**Q5: There is a critical “conserved” water molecule in the binding site. Can you identify this water molecule? What residue number does this water molecule have?**
This water molecule is water 308.

**Q6: Generate and save a figure clearly showing the two distinct chains of HIV-protease along with the ligand. You might also consider showing the catalytic residues ASP 25 in each chain and the critical water (we recommend “Ball & Stick” for these side-chains). Add this figure to your Quarto document.**

Here is a lovely figure of HIP-Pr with the catalytic ASP residues, the MK compound and the all important water 308.

# 3. Introduction to Bio3D in R
## The bio3d package for structural bioinformatics

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
```

```{r}
pdb
```

**Q7: How many amino acid residues are there in this pdb object?**
There are 198 AA residues in this pdb object.

**Q8: Name one of the two non-protein residues?**
The non-protein residues are HOH & MK1

**Q9: How many protein chains are in this structure?**
There are 2 protein chains.

```{r}
attributes(pdb)

head(pdb$atom)
```

# Predicting functional motions of a single structure

Let's finish today with a bioinformatics calculation to predict the functional motions of a PDB structure.

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")

# Perform flexiblity prediction
m <- nma(adk)
```

```{r}
plot(m)
mktrj(m, file="adk_m7.pdb")
```
