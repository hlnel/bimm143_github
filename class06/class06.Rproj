# All about functions in R

Functions are the way we get stuff done in R. We call a function to read data, compute stuff, plot stuff, etc.

R makes writing functions accessible but we should always start by trying to get a working snippet of code first before we write our function.

## Today's lab

We will grade a whole class of student assignments. We will always try to start with a simplified version of the problem.

```{r}
# Example input vectors to start with
student1 <- c(100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 100, 90)
student2 <- c(100, NA, 90, 90, 90, 90, 97, 80)
student3 <- c(90, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA)

grade1 <- mean(student1)
grade1
```

If we want the average, we can use the `mean()` function.
