Pertussis is a severe lung infection, also known as whooping cough.

We will begin by investigating the number of Pertussis cases per year in the US.

This data is available on the CDC website [here](https://www.cdc.gov/pertussis/surv-reporting/cases-by-year.html)

## Q1. With the help of the R “addin” package datapasta assign the CDC pertussis case number data to a data frame called cdc and use ggplot to make a plot of cases numbers over time.

```{r}
#| echo=FALSE
cdc <- data.frame(year = c(1922L,1923L,1924L,1925L,
                                          1926L,1927L,1928L,1929L,1930L,1931L,
                                          1932L,1933L,1934L,1935L,1936L,
                                          1937L,1938L,1939L,1940L,1941L,1942L,
                                          1943L,1944L,1945L,1946L,1947L,
                                          1948L,1949L,1950L,1951L,1952L,
                                          1953L,1954L,1955L,1956L,1957L,1958L,
                                          1959L,1960L,1961L,1962L,1963L,
                                          1964L,1965L,1966L,1967L,1968L,1969L,
                                          1970L,1971L,1972L,1973L,1974L,
                                          1975L,1976L,1977L,1978L,1979L,1980L,
                                          1981L,1982L,1983L,1984L,1985L,
                                          1986L,1987L,1988L,1989L,1990L,
                                          1991L,1992L,1993L,1994L,1995L,1996L,
                                          1997L,1998L,1999L,2000L,2001L,
                                          2002L,2003L,2004L,2005L,2006L,2007L,
                                          2008L,2009L,2010L,2011L,2012L,
                                          2013L,2014L,2015L,2016L,2017L,2018L,
                                          2019L,2020L,2021L),
         cases = c(107473,164191,165418,152003,

                                          120718,68687,45030,37129,60886,
                                          62786,31732,28295,32148,40005,

                                          2719,4083,6586,4617,5137,7796,6564,
                                          7405,7298,7867,7580,9771,11647,

                                          6124,2116)
       )
```

Let's have a little look at the data frame.

```{r}
head(cdc)
```

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r}
ggplot(cdc) +
  aes(year, cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Pertussis Cases by Year (1922-2019)",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Number of cases")
```

## Q2. Using the ggplot geom_vline() function add lines to your previous plot for the 1946 introduction of the wP vaccine and the 1996 switch to aP vaccine (see example in the hint below). What do you notice?

```{r}
ggplot(cdc) +
  aes(year, cases) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_line() +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1946, linetype = "dashed", col="blue") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1996, linetype = "dashed", col="red") +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2020, linetype = "dashed", col="darkgreen")
```

## Q3. Describe what happened after the introduction of the aP vaccine? Do you have a possible explanation for the observed trend?

There is a lag and then cases rise with a ~3 year cycle perhaps similar to that observed before to the first wP vaccine introduction.

# 3. Exploring CMI-PB data

Why is this vaccine-preventable disease on the upswing? To answer this question we need to investigate the mechanisms underlying waning protection against pertussis. This requires evaluation of pertussis-specific immune responses over time in wP and aP vaccinated individuals.

This is the goals of the CMI-PB project: https://www.cmi-pb.org/ 

The CMI-PB project makes its data available via "API-endpoint" that returns JSON format.

We will use the **jsonlite** package to access this data. The main function in this package is called `read_json()`.

```{r}
library(jsonlite)

# Subject table
subject <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/subject", simplifyVector = TRUE)
specimen <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/specimen", simplifyVector = TRUE)
titer <- read_json("http://cmi-pb.org/api/v4/plasma_ab_titer", simplifyVector = TRUE)
```

Let's have a look at these new objects:
```{r}
head(subject)
```

```{r}
head(titer)
```

## Q4. How many aP and wP infancy vaccinated subjects are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$infancy_vac)
```
There are 60 aP and 58 wP infancy vaccinated subjects in the dataset.

## Q5. How many Male and Female subjects/patients are in the dataset?

```{r}
table(subject$biological_sex)
```
There are 79 Female and 39 Male subjects in the dataset.

## Q6. What is the breakdown of race and biological sex (e.g. number of Asian females, White males etc…)?

```{r}
table(subject$race, subject$biological_sex)
```
The breakdown of race and biological sex is listed above.The most represented category in this dataset is White female subjects.

This data is not the most representative of the true population as the data was taken during the pandemic, making many reluctant to come in for data collection.

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
```

```{r}
today()
```

```{r}
today() - mdy("11-28-2001")
```

```{r}
time_length(today() - ymd("2002-1-17"), "years")
```




## Q7. Using this approach determine (i) the average age of wP individuals, (ii) the average age of aP individuals; and (iii) are they significantly different?

```{r}
# Use todays date to calculate age in days
subject$age <- today() - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)
```

```{r}
library(dplyr)

# aP
ap <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "aP")

round( summary( time_length( ap$age, "years" ) ) )
```
The average age of aP individuals is 26 years old.

```{r}
# wP
wp <- subject %>% filter(infancy_vac == "wP")
round( summary( time_length( wp$age, "years" ) ) )
```
The average age of wP individuals is 36 years old.

## Q8. Determine the age of all individuals at time of boost?

```{r}
subject$age <- ymd(subject$date_of_boost) - ymd(subject$year_of_birth)

subject$age_years <- time_length(subject$age, "years")

head(subject)
```

## Q9. With the help of a faceted boxplot or histogram (see below), do you think these two groups are significantly different?

```{r}
ggplot(subject) +
  aes(time_length(age, "year"),
      fill=as.factor(infancy_vac)) +
  geom_histogram(show.legend=FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(vars(infancy_vac), nrow=2) +
  xlab("Age in years")
```

As shown in the histograms, the two groups are significantly different. A p-value test can be used to confirm this.

```{r}
# Or use wilcox.test() 
x <- t.test(time_length( wp$age, "years" ),
       time_length( ap$age, "years" ))

x$p.value
```
This p-value is enough to prove that the two groups are significantly different.

# merge or join tables

## Q9. Complete the code to join specimen and subject tables to make a new merged data frame containing all specimen records along with their associated subject details:

```{r}
meta <- inner_join(specimen, subject)
head(meta)
```

## Q10. Now using the same procedure join meta with titer data so we can further analyze this data in terms of time of visit aP/wP, male/female etc.

Antibody measurements in the blood

```{r}
abdata <- inner_join(titer, meta)
head(abdata)
```

## Q11. How many specimens (i.e. entries in abdata) do we have for each isotype?

```{r}
table(abdata$isotype)
```

Let's focus on one of these IgG

```{r}
igg <- abdata %>% filter(isotype == "IgG")
head(igg)
```

Box plot of MFI_normalised vs antigen

```{r}
ggplot(igg) +
  aes(MFI_normalised, antigen,
      col=infancy_vac) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

```{r}
head(igg)
```

Focus in on IgG to the Pertussis Toxin (PT) antigen in the 2021 dataset

```{r}
igg.pt <- igg %>% filter(antigen == "PT", dataset == "2021_dataset")
```

```{r}
ggplot(igg.pt) +
  aes(planned_day_relative_to_boost,
      MFI_normalised,
      col=infancy_vac,
      group=subject_id) +
  geom_point()
```


## Q12. What are the different $dataset values in abdata and what do you notice about the number of rows for the most “recent” dataset?

```{r}
table(abdata$dataset)
```
There is much less in the most recent dataset, "2022_dataset". 

## Q13. Complete the following code to make a summary boxplot of Ab titer levels (MFI) for all antigens:

```{r}
ggplot(igg) +
  aes(MFI_normalised, antigen) +
  geom_boxplot() + 
    xlim(0,75) +
  facet_wrap(vars(visit), nrow=2)
```


```{r}
abdata.21 <- abdata %>% filter(dataset == "2021_dataset")

abdata.21 %>% 
  filter(isotype == "IgG",  antigen == "PT") %>%
  ggplot() +
    aes(x=planned_day_relative_to_boost,
        y=MFI_normalised,
        col=infancy_vac,
        group=subject_id) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_line() +
    geom_vline(xintercept=0, linetype="dashed") +
    geom_vline(xintercept=14, linetype="dashed") +
  labs(title="2021 dataset IgG PT",
       subtitle = "Dashed lines indicate day 0 (pre-boost) and 14 (apparent peak levels)")
```
